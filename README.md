A Bulma-friendly way to stick a table header, table footer, first column, or all three!

**[See It In Action](https://cityssm.github.io/bulma-sticky-table)**

## Installation

Download a release, or grab the code from npm.

`npm install @cityssm/bulma-sticky-table`

When building your stylesheet, import `_sticky-table.scss` AFTER you import Bulma.
This will ensure your colour customizations are used.

```scss
@import 'bulma/bulma';
@import '@cityssm/bulma-sticky-table/sticky-table';
```

Alternatively, if you are using Bulma without any customizations,
you can replace your Bulma stylesheet with `bulma-with-sticky-tables.css`.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/cityssm/bulma-sticky-table/bulma-with-sticky-table.css">
```

## Usage

Build your Bulma table as per usual, using the [Bulma Table Documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/table/) as your guide.

Then, add any combination of the following classes to your `<table>` tag.

Use `.has-sticky-header` to stick the header.

-   Note that the header should be inside of a `<thead>` tag, and each cell should use a `<th>` tag.

Use `.has-sticky-footer` to stick the footer.

-   Note that the footer should be inside of a `<tfoot>` tag, and each cell should use a `<th>` tag.

Use `.has-sticky-column` to stick the first column.

-   Note that the first cells in each table row should use the `<th>` tag.

### Note about `.table-container`

The Bulma `.table-container` wraps around a `.table` to assist with scrolling
around large tables.  The basic idea is that the container changes the `overflow`
CSS rules on the container.  This can affect the `.table`'s ability to stick
as you'd expect.

While `.has-sticky-column` will likely work as expected,
`.has-sticky-header` and `.has-sticky-footer` may not.  There are two options:

1.  **Remove the `.table-container` altogether**, and just use the `.table` as is with the desired sticky classes.

2.  Add some additional styles to the `.table-container` to change the vertical overflow rule and set a specific height on the container.  The example below uses the screen height.  Something smaller may be better, depending on your application.

```html
<div class="table-container" style="overflow-y:auto;max-height:100vh;">
  <table>
    <thead>...</thead>
    <tbody>...</tbody>
  </table>
</div>
```
